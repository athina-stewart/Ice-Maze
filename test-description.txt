Test Descriptions

-------------------------
test1.txt

This is a test in which the grid has a different number of grid
versus columns. There are also more rocks in this grid and the
objective is to verify that the graph is correctly built, that
is, all vertex neighbours are assigned and all vertexes are linked
correctly. In this test, a path to the exit can be found from all
starting squares.

-------------------------
test2.txt

This is a test containing a larger grid with more obstacles. The
objective was to be able to correctly detect which starting squares
would not have a path connected to the escape point

-------------------------
test3.txt

This test is scaled up from the second test. There are more squares
in the grid and also more obstacles that need to be properly
maneuvered so vertex neighbours can be added correctly.

-------------------------
test3.txt

This is a simple test that checks if the maze can be escaped.
If there is a rock in the exit then the person on the maze
will be trapped forever.
