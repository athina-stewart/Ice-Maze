# Ice-Maze

In this problem, there is the puzzle of finding an exit out of an ice maze. The ice-maze only has one exit from the pond and there may be rocks (obstacles) in this pond.

Importantly, in order to escape you must travel in one line until encoundering a rock or a corner of the pond.

In order to find the exit (if one exists), Dijkstra's algotihm has been implemented (using a priority queue).
